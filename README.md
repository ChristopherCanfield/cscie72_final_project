## CSCI E-72 Computer Graphics: Final Project

This project was created as part of the CSCI E-72 Computer Graphics course that I took in Fall 2013. This is an exploration game prototype, with an indoor and outdoor area. It has the following features:

- Implemented in JavaScript and WebGL
- Textures & lighting
- Particle systems
- Collision detection
- User interaction, such as opening doors and shooting projectiles
- Moveable camera with mouse look (though pointer lock wasn't implemented)
- Zone-based system to reduce cost of collision detection and to turn particle systems on or off (based on the KD-tree concept)
- Billboarding

WebGL-enabled browsers can access it [here](http://christopherdcanfield.com/projects/cscie72_final_project/).

The [three.js](http://threejs.org/) library was used to assist with WebGL. The textures are from Paul Bourke's texture library: http://paulbourke.net/texture_colour/
